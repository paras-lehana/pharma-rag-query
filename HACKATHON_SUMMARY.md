# 🏆 Pharmaceutical Compliance RAG - Hackathon Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Name:** Pharmaceutical Compliance RAG System  
**Built for:** Drug ban detection and regulatory compliance monitoring  
**Technology Stack:** Pathway AI, Python, Docker, RAG Architecture  
**Target Documents:** Gazette of India PDFs, regulatory notifications  

## 🚀 What We Built

A **real-time regulatory document monitoring system** that:

1. **Automatically ingests** Gazette of India PDFs and regulatory documents
2. **Processes and indexes** pharmaceutical compliance information using vector embeddings
3. **Provides instant search** for drug bans, scheduling changes, and regulatory updates
4. **Offers REST API** for integration with compliance systems
5. **Monitors in real-time** for new regulatory changes

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Smart Document Processing
- **Multi-format support**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT documents
- **High-resolution parsing**: Preserves tables and complex layouts
- **Multi-language support**: English and Hindi (for Gazette documents)
- **Metadata extraction**: Publication dates, drug names, regulatory actions

### 🧠 Advanced RAG Capabilities
- **Semantic search**: Find relevant regulations using natural language queries
- **Vector embeddings**: Uses `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1` optimized for pharmaceutical text  
- **Contextual chunking**: 512-token chunks with overlap for better context
- **Real-time indexing**: Live monitoring of document changes

### 🌐 Production-Ready API
- **POST /v1/retrieve**: Query documents with similarity search
- **GET /v1/statistics**: System health and indexing stats
- **GET /v1/inputs**: List all indexed documents
- **Docker deployment**: Container-ready with health checks

### 🎯 Pharmaceutical-Specific Optimizations
- **Priority terms**: Optimized for "banned", "prohibited", "schedule", "drug", etc.
- **Regulatory context**: Understands pharmaceutical compliance language
- **Citation tracking**: Maintains page references for legal compliance
- **Change monitoring**: Detects new regulatory updates automatically

## 🎮 Demo Scenario

### Sample Queries You Can Test:

1. **"Which drugs were banned in the latest notification?"**
   - Returns: Tramadol, Codeine combinations, Dextromethorphan

2. **"Show me Schedule H1 changes"**
   - Returns: Pregabalin and Alprazolam additions

3. **"What are the penalties for selling prohibited drugs?"**
   - Returns: Up to 10 years imprisonment, Rs. 10 lakh fine

4. **"Alternative therapies for banned pain medications"**
   - Returns: Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac recommendations

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps!)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd pharma-rag-query

# 2. Run the quick start script
./start.sh

# 3. Test the API
./test_api.py
```

**That's it!** The system will be running at `http://localhost:8000`
