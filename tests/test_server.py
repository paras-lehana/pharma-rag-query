Server Infrastructure Test Suite

PURPOSE:
Comprehensive validation of server infrastructure, endpoints, and operational
capabilities of the pharmaceutical compliance system. Ensures robust server
performance and reliability under various conditions.

WHAT IT TESTS:
1. Server Infrastructure:
   - HTTP server startup and initialization
   - Port binding and network configuration
   - Process management and lifecycle
   - Resource allocation and utilization

2. API Endpoint Validation:
   - Health check endpoint availability
   - Query processing endpoint functionality
   - Authentication and security mechanisms
   - Rate limiting and throttling behavior

3. Request/Response Handling:
   - HTTP method support (GET, POST, OPTIONS)
   - Content-type processing and validation
   - Request payload parsing and validation
   - Response formatting and content delivery

4. Error Handling and Recovery:
   - Invalid request processing
   - Server error response generation
   - Timeout handling and recovery
   - Graceful degradation scenarios

5. Performance and Scalability:
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Response time benchmarking
   - Load testing under stress conditions

6. Security and Compliance:
   - Input sanitization validation
   - CORS policy enforcement
   - Request logging and monitoring
   - Security header implementation

WHEN TO RUN:
- During server deployment validation
- Before production environment setup
- For load testing and performance validation
- When troubleshooting server-related issues
- As part of continuous integration testing

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Server starts and binds to configured port successfully
- All API endpoints respond correctly to valid requests
- Error conditions are handled gracefully
- Performance metrics meet operational requirements
- Security measures function as designed

DEPENDENCIES:
- Python HTTP server capabilities
- Network configuration and port availability
- Server configuration files and environment
- Load testing utilities and benchmarking tools
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

SCOPE:
This test focuses on server infrastructure and API layer functionality.
For application-specific testing, use test_live_server.py or test_query.py
